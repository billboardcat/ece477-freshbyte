## About FreshByte
FreshByte is a sensor-based food quality assurance system that monitors and issues real-time alerts
regarding food longevity based on environmental conditions and type of food.

Data reported from a pressure sensor, timer, thermometer, hygrometer, and gas sensors will be used to monitor the food
and notify the user if the conditions are out of specification as well as how much longer the food can be safely consumed.

Users will input the type of food through the use of a display and buttons. The display will be used to notify users of when a certain
threshold of longevity has been reached.

### Project Specific Success Criteria
- [ ] An ability to read pressure sensor data to determine if food is in the box.
- [ ] An ability to transmit data to external device for analysis over a WiFi connection.
- [ ] An ability to read battery charge level data through I2C using a PMIC.
- [ ] ability to show environmental conditions on the display.
- [ ] An ability to wake the display using a proximity sensor.
